# ocmods-vol1
Some OCmods for Opencart (2.2 could work on earlier versions) that I use

##alfra_disable_zone.ocmod.xml
Removes region/zone/state from register new user, guest checkout, address edit, shipping estimate, payment address forms.

##alfra_sort_by.ocmod.xml
This is a very simple file modification. It overrides `$sort` (and `$order`) default values. `$order` is by default set to `'ASC'` and `$sort` is set to `'p.sort_order'`. Make changes to this file to match your needs.
